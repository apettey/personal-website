      "description": "During my tenure at OLX Group, I led a newly established team within the Trust and Safety department with the primary objective of re-architecting the global fraud detection and moderation systems on the OLX platform. As the team manager, my responsibilities encompassed all aspects, including team recruitment, compensation management, and personnel decisions.\n\nTo achieve our goals, we employed a diverse technology stack, leveraging Spring Boot, Python, NodeJS, and AWS to implement a comprehensive system. During this time, the company's strategic focus centered on enhancing the deployment of machine learning models across OLX's data infrastructure. To achieve this, we set forth the following key priorities for the platform:\n\n1. Establishment of a standardized and easily accessible API for data ingestion.\n2. Real-time data access capabilities.\n3. Storage integration with the global data lake to facilitate model training.\n4. Effective cataloging and data description functionalities.\n5. Compliance with GDPR requirements.\n6. Handling more than one billion events daily.\n\nOur platform design was driven by a \"Machine Learning first\" approach, emphasizing the following attributes:\n\n1. Facilitating easy model training.\n2. Streamlining model testing and evaluation.\n3. Simplifying model deployment procedures.\n4. Establishing efficient model monitoring mechanisms.\n\nMoreover, we developed a simplified API to streamline communications and actions related to Users and Content within the OLX ecosystem. Additionally, we crafted a user interface tailored to multiple countries, enabling efficient moderation and interpretation of system information.\n\nTo implement the proposed system, we opted for a distributed architecture, employing the following technology stack:\n\nAWS services:\n- Kinesis\n- Lambda\n- SQS/SNS\n- Batch\n- SageMaker\n- DynamoDB\n- RDS\n- ElasticCache\n- ElasticSearch\n\nSpringBoot, in conjunction with Kinesis Client Libraries and DynamoDB, played pivotal roles in supporting our architecture, while ReactJS was utilized for frontend development.\n\nThe successful execution of this project significantly contributed to OLX Group's data-driven and fraud-resistant ecosystem, empowering the platform to effectively combat fraud while accommodating the scalable deployment of machine learning models.",

      "description": "I was a member of a dedicated team that successfully developed the Global Image Storage Service, codenamed \"Apollo,\" for OLX Group. With OLX boasting over 300 million users engaged in buying and selling items annually, the seamless availability and efficient handling of images were fundamental to facilitating transactions across the global platform.\n\nOur project was meticulously crafted using Java and Spring Boot, operating on the AWS infrastructure with S3, RDS, and EC2. Initially, the service was managed through K8s and later transitioned to EKS for improved scalability and management.\n\nApollo was conceived with a comprehensive set of requirements, including:\n\n1. Secure Image and Document Storage: Ensuring the utmost security and reliability in storing images and related documents were integral parts of the development process.\n\n2. Real-Time Image Manipulation: Implementing a robust suite of real-time image manipulation functionalities, including cropping, image quality adjustments, watermarking, and more, allowed users to have dynamic and interactive experiences.\n\n3. Cloud-Native Redundancy: A fully redundant and multi-region cloud-native architecture was meticulously designed to enhance system resilience and ensure high availability.\n\n4. Edge Distribution: Integrating with Akamai initially and later transitioning to CloudFront, we optimized content delivery to offer efficient edge distribution worldwide.\n\n5. High Request Throughput and Scalability: Our focus on serving over 10,000 requests per minute while ensuring further scalability was a critical aspect of the project to meet user demands and handle potential edge node losses.\n\nThe successful integration of Apollo across the entire OLX Group portfolio of major products underscored our team's exceptional capabilities and dedication to delivering reliable and performant services. Following the successful migration, we embarked on the development of metadata services and storage solutions for video and audio data. This encompassed implementing advanced features, such as audio transcription and translation, facilitating message moderation, and supporting other auxiliary functionalities.\n\nThroughout the development lifecycle, our team upheld the highest standards of professionalism and technical expertise. We navigated intricate technical challenges with skill and precision, aligning the project with OLX Group's overarching business goals. As a result, the Global Image Storage Service significantly contributed to OLX Group's prominence as a premier global online marketplace, enhancing user experiences, and driving continued growth and success.",
